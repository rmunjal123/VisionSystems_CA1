Installation Guidelines:

Windows, linux:
--------------

1. conda create -n y1-s2-ca1 python=3.6 numpy=1.18.1 opencv=3.4.2 matplotlib=3.1.3 tensorflow=1.14.0 tensorflow-gpu=1.14.0 keras=2.3.1 keras-gpu=2.3.1 cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn=7.6.5 scipy=1.4.1 scikit-learn=0.22.1 pillow=6.1.0 ipython=7.12.0 spyder=4.0.1 imgaug cython pathlib yaml pandas pydot graphviz seaborn
(Assume Nvidia Cuda 10.2 is installed according to your Nvidia driver version (see https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html#binary-compatibility), and cudnn 7.6.5 installed, get cudnn from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

2. conda activate y1-s2-ca1

3. conda spyder


Training the model:

-Unzip the files downloaded from Github
-Run the maskrcnn_steel_defect_detection.py file for running the complete training.
-Model will be saved for each epoch in the local folder.Note that the size of model for each epoch will be 250 MB.

Testing the model:

-Once the training is complete, update the path of the final model in the test section of the code for running inference.
-Uncomment the inference section of the code for getting output on the test images.
-Run the inference code only to get the output masked images.

Using Pre-trained model for inference: 
Please downlaod the pre-trained model from 
https://nusu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/e0385030_u_nus_edu/EcNzOTG_nFdCnzMFjxfP4-MBskJRIJsqj0B91Mzo2pEZVg?email=tanjenhong%40nus.edu.sg&e=jIy3Tn 
and put the correct path in the inference code to test the model.
